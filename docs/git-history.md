# Git History

## What it does

Each Project can open a native, read-only Git History window. Use Leader then
H (default Leader: Ctrl+B), or find **Open project Git history** in the bindings
help or keybindings editor. Opening again surfaces the existing window, including
a minimized window or an inactive tab. It floats initially and supports the same
tiling, tabbing, zoom, and workspace restore behavior as other viewers.

The timeline shows commits reachable from all refs and HEAD in topological
order, with colored branch/merge lanes, commit subjects, branch/tag decorations,
authors, and author dates. Hover a row for its full hash and untruncated metadata.
Scroll vertically through history; horizontal scrolling keeps wide graphs and
metadata reachable in a narrow window. Refresh starts a new read from the current
repository state. An empty repository and a failed Git read have distinct states.
Git must be available on PATH. Linked worktrees and detached HEAD work through
Git's own repository discovery.

Text and row geometry follow the theme font size (Appearance → Font size, or
Ctrl+Scroll zoom), scaled from the 13px default the same way the board does.
Zooming keeps the same rows in view by rescaling the scroll offset.

Branch selection and checkout/switching belong to the next task. Diffs, search,
context menus, and other Git operations are outside this viewer's scope.

## Design and implementation plan

The implementation follows the existing Project viewer seam instead of adding
another window system:

1. Add a Git History Content variant, singleton opener, command, and cold
   workspace snapshot. Restore derives its directory from the owning Project.
2. Read one Git log stream on background threads. Send a bounded batch only
   when the viewer requests it. Keep the graph frontier across batches so
   scrolling cannot introduce false roots or change lane colors.
3. Precompute row edges on the worker. Paint only the viewport's rows with egui
   virtualization, without scanning the loaded history on each frame.
4. Validate split/join behavior, stream framing, real repository variants,
   restore, large-history rendering, and the actual native window.

`Graph` tracks pending parent commits as a frontier. Each pending hash occupies
one lane. Visiting a commit replaces its lane with unseen parents, reuses lanes
for shared parents, and compacts completed lanes. Colors travel with pending
commits, rather than with column positions. Edges connect the before and after
frontiers across each row; disconnected tips and roots do not invent edges.

Git subprocess creation, pipe reads, parsing, graph layout, cancellation, and
child reaping happen off the GUI thread. A process supervisor can kill Git even
when its output reader is blocked. Closing or refreshing disconnects the old
stream and discards its replies; there is no shared receiver for stale data.
Loaded pages are also freed on a background thread. No repository writes,
network fetches, or terminal Sessions are created by the viewer.

The viewport requests more rows near the loaded end. There is no fixed history
cutoff. Memory grows with the history actually visited, not the full repository
at open; Git may itself traverse a large graph before returning the first row.
The status count is the loaded count until the stream reaches EOF. Refresh is
manual, keeping a single stream's ordering and decorations stable while browsing.

## Validation

Run `cargo test --target-dir target/agent git_history -- --nocapture` for graph,
parser, batch, repository, virtualization, and workspace tests. The repository
fixture exercises an annotated tag, merge, linked worktree, detached commit,
empty repository, and non-repository error. The graph cases include linear,
diamond, octopus, and disconnected history.

On 2026-09-23, the synthetic 100,000-commit test built the graph in 148 ms and
rendered twelve headless debug frames in 39 ms. After a large scroll it painted
only the visible rows around commit 1,700. This is a bounded-work regression
check, not a release-build end-to-end frame-time benchmark.

Native screenshots use a seeded workspace and fixture repository under
`target/history-evidence`, with isolated APPDATA and global skill installation
disabled. The build-screenshot script captures via PrintWindow without driving
the user's mouse or keyboard.

  module-local tests.
- `src/wm.rs`: `Content::GitHistory`, `open_git_history_window`, snapshot capture
  and restore, and the Project-scoped command dispatch.
- `src/keymap.rs`: `Command::OpenGitHistory` and its default binding.
- `src/workspace.rs`: `ContentSnap::GitHistory` (window identity only; cached
  commits and scroll position are not persisted).
